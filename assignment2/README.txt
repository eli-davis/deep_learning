Morris Kline - Calculus. You can read it online by borrowing it from the Internet Archive (you can sign up for a free account, here is the link to the book). https://archive.org/details/calculusintuitiv0000klin_z3k9/page/582/mode/2up

Ideally Chapters 1-7, though that is a lot of ground to cover. If you're limited for time I would say please read Chapters 2 and Chapters 7.

Chapter 7 is the chain rule, which is really good to have a refresher on.

Once you have this refresher, we'll
(1) go into the math of back prop for a one layer network
(2) code for back prop for a one layer network
(3) go into the math of back prop for a two layer network
(4) code for back prop for a one layer network

Completing 1-4 above if the foundational background of math needed, as deeper networks are a natural follow on of a 2 layer networks. For larger networks we'll plan to switch to pytorch which does the back prop calculations for you. Still having this math background we're working on in 1-4 above is super important to having a thorough understanding of what's happening under the hood.

If you can focus on reading Morris Kline for now, we can go into the math for (1) and (2) on Tuesday. (or later, if the math refresher takes more time.)
