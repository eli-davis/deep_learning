todo:
- see data/ and data/visualize_data.py for working with the data
- rewrite pseudo_code.py in your own words with detailed comments, goal is to develop an intuition
- from there visualize the weights for digits 0-9 (save each as 16x16 image, optionally upsampled -- should look like a "template" pattern for each digit)
